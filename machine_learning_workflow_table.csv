Install Libraries,"import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression","import numpy as np

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier"
Download Dataset,df = pd.read_csv('data.csv'),df = pd.read_csv('data.csv'),df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
Data Preprocessing,"Data cleaning, normalization, splitting",Same as Linear Regression,Same as Linear Regression
Feature Engineering,Feature selection techniques,Same as Linear Regression,Same as Linear Regression
Define Model,model = LinearRegression(),model = LogisticRegression(),model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
Train Model,"model.fit(X_train, y_train)","model.fit(X_train, y_train)","model.fit(X_train, y_train)"
Visualize Results,Plotting predictions,"ROC curve, confusion matrix",Decision tree plot
Interpret Results,"Coefficients, RÂ² value","Coefficients, accuracy","Decision paths, feature importance"
